We&#39;ve compiled some of our favorite parts below, to give you a taste. </p><br>\n<p>Behold, 12 pieces of actually practical advice for a struggling, emerging or really any sort of artist.</p><br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>1. Take the job.</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t be one of those cliché art school kids who considers himself above the idea of art as commodity. Take the commercial work. Take the design work. Do the band&#39;s poster for $20 and a six-pack. Do whatever it takes to be able to call yourself a working artist. It&#39;s a noble title, regardless of the particulars.&quot; <em>-</em>Noah Antieau<em>, </em>art dealer</p><br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>2. Make nice!</strong> \"Your best connections are your peers. Stay in contact with them. Be curious. Visit other artist's studios and add like-minded people to your mailing list.\" -Cara Enteles, artist</p><br>\n<p><strong>3. Do you.</strong> &quot;Aim to have people recognize your work in a crowded room ... to know immediately that it&#39;s undeniably yours.&quot; -Lori Field, artist </p><br>\n<br>\n<p><strong> 4. Get some perspective.</strong> &quot;Gaining perspective by observing your practice amongst a field of others, and the culture and time in which it is done, is a career goal that follows a wide arc ... It is not the sole responsibility of your art dealer, for example, to place your work in cultural context, nor should you allow this without your input.&quot; -Martin Kruck, artist </p><br>\n<p><strong>5. It's just another job.</strong> &quot;When I&#39;m talking with younger artists I stress that making, exhibiting and selling art in a commercial gallery is just like any other job one hopes to be successful at. It means working hard, honoring deadlines and trusting your co-workers to do their jobs well too.&quot; -William Baczek, art dealer</p><br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>6. Don't go crazy with the zeros.</strong> &quot;Don&#39;t raise your prices too fast because once they are up, you should not lower them.&quot; -Jayme McLellan, art dealer </p><br>\n<p><strong>7. More, more, more!</strong> &quot;Feed your output with as much input (books, lectures, films, leisure, rest) as you can handle, and in some cases, more than you can manage.&quot; -Didier William, artist </p><br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>8. Keep your friends close and your inspiration closer.</strong> &quot;Now there are endless images at your fingertips, but you need to find the ones that awaken your creativity and keep them near to you. Sometimes it can be something blurry and vague ... I have this one little scrap of paper with a very low-res image of a kitten&#39;s face on it, and something about it makes me come back to it again and again, trying to capture something elusive about it. When you find an image like that, hold onto it like it was gold.&quot; -Marion Peck, artist </p><br>\n<p><strong>9. Get that domain name stat.</strong> &quot;You don&#39;t need business cards. You do need a website.&quot; -Zach Feuer, art dealer</p><br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>10. Don't get comfortable.</strong> &quot;You may have to work at a real job while you are making this happen. DO NOT get a creative job. Get a job you won&#39;t get comfortable in. Save all your creative juices for your own art practice!&quot; -Martha Rich, artist  </p><br>\n<p><strong>11. Embrace the tribe.</strong> &quot;It&#39;s good to remember (not when you are making new work as it might be better to forget) that there are armies of manically mono-focused people (I almost said monsters) out there who want something close to what you want. They are your tribe, not your enemy.&quot; -David Humphrey, artist </p><br>\n<br>\n<p><strong>12. Go outside.</strong> \"Stay deeply connected to what's going on in your own art world. Under no circumstances isolate yourself in the studio with a solitary practice, thinking you're some kind of lone wolf or Van Gogh.\" -Mark Wolfe, art dealer</p><br>\n<p><strong>Also on HuffPost:</strong></p><br>\n <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>","categories":[]},{"title":"Man Charged In Detox Center Shooting Resented Homeless: Police","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/21/wyoming-detox-center-shooting-resented-homeless_n_7839844.html","author":"Steven Hoffer","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 05:47:50 -0700","contentSnippet":"\nRIVERTON, Wyo.

(AP) — A parks employee in a central Wyoming city who said he was incensed by homeless people drinking in parks slipped into a detox center over the weekend and shot two men in the head as they were lying in their beds, killing one and critically wounding the other, authorities charge.</p><br>\n<p>A judge on Monday ordered Roy Clyde, 32, of Riverton held without bond. Clyde is charged with one count of first-degree murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder. A preliminary hearing was set for July 29.</p><br>\n<p>Riverton police Capt. Eric Murphy said Monday that Clyde is a 13-year employee of the City of Riverton. Murphy said Clyde called police after the shooting at the Center of Hope facility and reported it. Police arrested him nearby.</p><br>\n<p>Clyde told investigators that he targeted the detox facility because he was tired of cleaning up after homeless people, Murphy said. \"And basically he was angry at that, and that's what precipitated him to go and do this violent act,\" Murphy said.</p><br>\n<p>Despite Roy Clyde&#39;s reported complaint, there was no immediate indication that anyone inside the Center of Hope facility — including the victims — was homeless at the time of Saturday&#39;s attack. Moreover, police say the center caters to all segments of the population with addiction problems.</p><br>\n<p>According to police statement filed in court Monday, Clyde told investigators he had long been considering killing people he referred to as &quot;park rangers.&quot; In Riverton, the term &quot;park rangers&quot; refers to homeless alcoholics — most of them American Indians. Many come to the city from the surrounding Wind River Indian Reservation, where alcohol is illegal, and drink in the parks.</p><br>\n<p>The reservation is home to both the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes. A spokesman for the Northern Arapaho Tribe said Monday that both victims in the shooting, whom authorities have not yet publicly identified, were Northern Arapaho.</p><br>\n<p>Police Det. Scott Peters filed a statement in Fremont County Circuit Court on Monday to support the charges against Clyde.</p><br>\n<p>\"Clyde admitted that he had been considering killing people he referred to as 'park rangers,'\" Peters wrote, adding that Clyde stated his decision was not race-based.</p><br>\n<p>\"He specifically indicated that if he had encountered white people meeting his criteria, he would have killed them as well,\" Peters wrote.</p><br>\n<p>Fremont County Attorney Patrick J. LeBrun declined comment on the case. He said Clyde didn't yet have an attorney.</p><br>\n<p>According to Murphy, Clyde walked through the back door of the Center of Hope, passed two staff members and went to an area for clients, where he shot the men. As he walked back out, he set down a handgun and was arrested soon thereafter.</p><br>\n<p>Some staff members and clients of the detox center locked themselves in a bathroom when the shooting started, Murphy said.</p><br>\n<p>The center, run by Volunteers of America, caters to anyone with addiction problems. Law enforcement agencies commonly take all sorts of people there who have been abusing alcohol or drugs, Murphy said.</p><br>\n<p>\"They have different levels of treatment,\" he said. \"If they encounter somebody who's intoxicated, they can take them there for the evening until they sober up.\"</p><br>\n<p>A telephone call to the center went unanswered on Monday.</p><br>\n<p><em>Also on The Huffington Post:</em></p><br>\n <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>","categories":[]},{"title":"10 Ways Gratitude Makes Your Life Better","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-casano/gratitude-research_b_7707042.html","author":"Tom Casano","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 05:47:42 -0700","contentSnippet":"It's no accident that all of the major world religions employ some form of gratitude in their rituals.

It's simply because it makes our daily life better, even if you're not religious nor spiritual.<br>\n<br>\nGratitude is the feeling of being thankful and showing appreciation for what is in our lives.  And thankfulness and appreciation are a pathway to a life of happiness and well-being.  When you pause and recognize all of the wonderful things in your life, you feel happier.  Appreciation keeps us focused on what is already good in our lives, and opens up the doorway to more goodness to flow into our lives.  Gratitude also equips us to handle setbacks and failures in a more resilient way.  Science is producing <a href=\"http://happierhuman.com/the-science-of-gratitude/\">mounting research</a> that our lives are much better when we practice gratitude.<br>\n<br>\nAnd indeed, gratitude <em>does</em> make your life better in the following ways...<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>1. You Feel More Satisfied</strong></u><br>\nNot completely happy with your life?  Gratitude is a lasting feeling that sustains you longer than other fleeting sensations.  Grateful people are more satisfied with their lives because they focus more on what they do appreciate in their life.  When you practice gratitude, you take time to appreciate the things that you're thankful for in your life.  And this means that you won't be longing as much for what's missing in your life, because you won't pay as much attention to it.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>2. You Motivate Others</strong></u><br>\nWhen you say \"thank you\" to someone, they feel that you appreciate what you did for them, even if just a little bit.  Saying \"thank you\" is therefore a powerful motivator for others to keep helping you again, because you are rewarding them with your appreciation.  Have you ever noticed how it feels when someone doesn't appreciate what you did for them?  It makes you not want to help them again in the future because they don't appreciate it.  Small thank you's go a long way, whether it's a simple text message or a thoughtful email, you can never show someone enough gratitude.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>3. You're Happier</strong></u><br>\nGrateful people are happier.  They're more in tune with what's going well in their lives and focus more on the positive.  When you actually count your blessings (I'm grateful for today's beautiful weather, for my new shoes, for my close friends, etc) it puts you in a positive and uplifting mood.  It's very enjoyable to recognize the things that you might have been taking for granted, and to feel joy for having them in your life.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>4. You're More Resilient</strong></u><br>\nThroughout your life you'll experience many setbacks and failures.  So having good coping skills is vital for us to have a thriving and successful life.  When life knocks you down yet you still practice gratitude, you can humbly appreciate the temporary defeat as a learning lesson.  When you're faced with challenges, you can thank God or the Universe for giving you an opportunity to practice your patience and strength.  When you're grateful you focus more on the opportunities that failures give you, rather than its negative consequences.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>5. You Deepen Your Social Ties</strong></u><br>\nGratitude has the power to deepen your social bonds and connections with others.  When you live in a state of gratitude, you have better relationships with your peers.  It also enhances your ability to form and nurture relationships, as your friends and family members experience the positive vibes of your appreciation for them and for life.  Your energy changes when you're grateful, and you go from being a \"downer\" to being a positive person.  And this is very attractive to everyone else around and strengthens your relationships.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>6. You Have Better Health</strong></u><br>\nGratitude has been linked to better physical health, as well as <a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/Wood-GratitudeSleep.pdf\">better sleep</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656607001286\">reduced stress</a> levels.  You can live a much better life when you're grateful because as you improve your relationship to the world, you feel better within your body.  Grateful people take better care of themselves as they appreciate their health more.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>7. You Increase Your Self-control</strong></u><br>\nAs <a href=\"http://www.mindful.org/news/how-gratitude-helps-us-make-better-decisions-study\">David DeSteno says</a>, \"When you're faced with a chal­lenging temptation in the moment, rather than solely trying to exert willpower, simply stop­ping and thinking of some­thing you're grateful for should enhance your ability to make a wiser decision.\"  As life <a href=\"http://www.lifecoachspotter.com\">coach</a> Peter Lambert says, gratitude gives you more patience and makes you less selfish.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>8. Your Relationships Improves</strong></u><br>\nWhen you're more grateful and generous to the people who you care most about, your relationships improve.  Not only will they feel more appreciated by you, but when they feel more appreciated and cared for, they'll reflect positive feelings back towards you.  As opposed to taking each other for granted, when you truly appreciate your significant other, your relationship becomes more magical again.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>9. You're Less Materialistic</strong></u><br>\nWhen you appreciate what you already have, you realize that a bigger house or a new car are not the things that will really make you happier deep down.  In fact, material things can actually feel sort of empty and meaningless.  But when you're thankful that you have a roof over your head and plenty of food to eat -- something not everyone around the world has -- you won't be as tied to physical things anymore.<br>\n<br>\n<u><strong>10. You Enrich Your Children</strong></u><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440507000386\">Research has shown</a> that when you encourage gratitude in children, it has some remarkable effects.  It turns out that kids who are grateful are happier, experience less volatile emotions, and feel that life has more meaning to them.<br>\n<br>\nGratitude is an emotion that's worth cultivating as it will make your life better.  You can start simply, by thinking of five things in your day today that you're grateful for.  There's no doubt that we all want to be happy, have good relationships, and good health.  The only thing you need to do to create more of these good things in your life, is to cultivate the gratitude within you.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Do you want to feel more grateful and happier in your life?

But it wasn't easy; I had to rebuild my life from scratch. Less than ten years later, I faced a decision that threatened to erase most of what I had accomplished, and I hesitated as I weighed the consequences.<br>\n<br>\nIn 1988, I lived and worked in Manhattan as Head of Mortgage Backed Securities Marketing for Merrill Lynch. I analyzed financial products, accompanied salespeople on customer calls, and spoke at seminars. Every morning I used the squawk box to broadcast a trade idea to the New York trading floor and U.S. branch offices: \"sell this callable corporate, buy this tranche of a collateralized mortgage obligation,\" or vice versa. It was a great gig.<br>\n<br>\nIn our area of the vast trading floor, the curved continuous rows of desks with multi-line switchboards, Bloomberg terminals, computers, and squawk boxes rose in amphitheater-like tiers.<br>\n<br>\nIt was a late September morning. Everyone had a clear view of the stripper who removed her top to entertain the soon-to-be-married head options trader. The stripper finished her routine, and I shrugged it off and went back to work. My past objections to my boss had gone nowhere.<br>\n<br>\nThat afternoon, another stripper arrived to entertain another soon-to-be-married trader. She performed around 15 feet in front of me, in front of the men and women who worked for me, and in front of a visiting female customer, a bank portfolio manager. The spectacle was broadcast over the internal U.S. network. The music alerted everyone in the branch offices as to why business had stopped and distracted New York traders weren't answering their phones.<br>\n<br>\nThe stripper's face contorted in concentration. She was completely naked. She balanced on the arm of the trader's chair and thrust her hips towards his face -- I suppose Sheryl Sandberg would tell her to just \"lean in.\"<br>\n<br>\nMen gathered around to watch and shout encouragement or make lewd remarks. George, my boss, was in the front of the group.<br>\n<br>\n\"She could lose a little weight,\" said a male voice to my right.<br>\n<br>\n\"No way,\" responded another, \"her tits would be smaller.\"<br>\n<br>\nA young woman who worked for me walked off the trading floor. She scooted past me with a pained expression and whispered, \"I'll be back when it's all over.\"<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://myBook.to/eDecisions\"><img alt=\"Decisions: Life and Death on Wall Street\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-02-1433255329-877212-decisions200300.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0px 5px\"></a><br>\n<br>\nAnother woman who worked for me was a devout Roman Catholic. She stared in stunned, angry silence, and then hid her head behind the papers on her desk, literally burying herself in her work.<br>\n<br>\nI laughed inwardly. I had fled my ex-husband's homeland, Iran, in June 1979 for the land of liberty. The Islamic Republic of Iran forced unwilling women to wear the chador, a black sheet that covered their bodies and hair. Now, back home in the USA, my college-educated male colleagues, \"the best and brightest,\" paid a woman during business hours to put on a show with nothing on her body. In both cases men tried to control the where, when, and how of female sexuality. This is still better than living in Iran, I thought. But it was a false choice, and anyway, at the moment I didn't feel liberated; I felt trapped by unpleasant choices. I made my decision.<br>\n<br>\nI pulled the pin and tossed the career grenade. Merrill Lynch's entire U.S. trading network heard my easily-recognized voice broadcast over the music: \"I wish to apologize to the women who work with me and for me. This performance is not an indication of management's attitude to the firm's female employees.\"<br>\n<br>\n<strong><br>\nThe next morning</strong> I stood outside Mike's [Head of the Mortgage Backed Securities Department] office and steeled myself before opening the door. I walked in and glanced at what he once told me was his favorite poster: an advertisement showing the horizontal contours of a nude, a wine bottle and a Ferrari 308GTB. The caption read: \"decisions, decisions.\"<br>\n<br>\nThe iconic poster looked out of place in the office of this balding, overweight, middle-aged married man; there was a college dorm room wall somewhere just crying for it.<br>\n<br>\nMike eyed me coldly. \"You know I've always supported your position one hundred percent. I wanted to stop it, but your broadcast tied my hands. It would have appeared to the guys that I was giving in to your demands. You're a big girl, you understand these things.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"I know you've always supported my point of view, and I'm sorry if anything I've done has inconvenienced you.\" I should have stopped there, but I soldiered on. \"I don't recall broadcasting any demands, however.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Do you realize,\" he said angrily, \"that my boss might have heard you? Do you know what kind of a position that would have put me in?\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I completely understand how awkward you must feel.\"<br>\n<br>\nMike grudgingly spoke again. \"There will be no more strippers on the trading floor, and I don't ever want to hear anything more on the subject.\"<br>\n<br>\nHe didn't need to add that my career in the mortgage department was over. Years later I looked back on my decision to defy Merrill's status quo as one of many incidents in my career that informed my resolve to stand up to slick bullies spouting false narratives. It is counterintuitive, but the more tension-filled situations with uncertain outcomes one confronts, the easier it becomes to handle them. At that moment, however, I thought I had killed my career. I did not yet know that my abandonment of unwholesome appeasement was responsible for an exciting new beginning that would put me in a front row seat during the biggest financial crisis in world history.<br>\n<br>\n<em>The previous was excerpted with permission from <a href=\"http://myBook.to/eDecisions\">Decisions: Life and Death on Wall Street</a>, Janet Tavakoli's Wall Street memoir of how personal and professional decisions reshaped people's lives, drove some to despair, and changed the landscape of global finance.</em><br>\n<br>\nSee also: \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nomi-prins/janet-tavakoli-decisions_b_7159164.html\">Review: Janet Tavakoli's <em>Decisions: Life and Death on Wall Street</em></a>\" <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>","categories":[]},{"title":"Lawfare and the Threat of Human Rights","link":"","author":"Nicola Perugini","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 05:45:18 -0700","contentSnippet":"Following the dawn of the new millennium, conservative forces within liberal democracies have been at the forefront of a ...","content":"<em>Following the dawn of the new millennium, conservative forces within liberal democracies have been at the forefront of a campaign against human rights organizations. This relatively new campaign is intricately linked to the \"war on terrorism\" and is part of a backlash against efforts of liberal human rights organizations and cause lawyers to subject warfare to legal analysis and oversight. The objective of the campaign is to undermine human rights NGOs that have been providing evidence in criminal suits brought against military and government officials in courts that exercise universal jurisdiction. In order to accomplish this goal conservatives are mobilizing the term lawfare -- which combines the words law and warfare and is defined as the use of law for realizing a military objective -- to reframe liberal human rights NGOs as a national security threat. What follows is a short adaptation of chapter two from</em> The Human Right to Dominate.<br>\n<br>\nLinked together by a shared mission and common political targets, conservative NGOs from numerous countries have created a united front and a network that increasingly challenges liberal human rights NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.  UN Watch monitors the \"just application of UN Charter principles\" and combats the \"disproportionate attention and unfair treatment applied by the UN towards Israel,\" while Global Governance Watch, a joint project of the American Enterprise Institute and the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, scrutinizes \"how international organizations [including human rights NGOs] influence domestic political outcomes...\"  In Israel, NGO Monitor follows the work of liberal human rights organizations and couches its criticism in security parlance.<br>\n<br>\nNGO Monitor's line of reasoning was articulated in an article entitled \"NGOs Make War on Israel\" penned by its founder political scientist Gerald Steinberg,  who in a different venue also claimed that human rights are being exploited as a \"weapon against Israel.\" Steinberg thus tapped into the post-9/11 conservative trend in the US, which began employing the term lawfare in order to describe the endeavor of individuals and groups who appeal to courts against practices of state violence emanating from the so-called global war on terrorism -- such as torture, extra-judicial executions, and the bombing of civilian urban infrastructure.<br>\n<br>\nA paradigmatic and early example of the use of lawfare in domestic courts occurred in 1998 when Spain requested that the United Kingdom extradite fascist General Augusto Pinochet on grounds of widespread torture carried out during U.S.-led Operation Condor in which Pinochet was implicated. Since then hundreds of suits have been filed in countries such as Belgium, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom, primarily against military personnel and government officials from Africa, Latin America and the former Yugoslavia, but the term lawfare, in its negative connotation gained credence as a threat when suits were filed against officials from the US and Israel. <br>\n<br>\nNotwithstanding US opposition to such suits, high-ranking government officials and CIA agents were being held accountable for rendition practices in absentia in German and Italian national courts that exercise universal jurisdiction. Hence, in 2005, a 24-page Pentagon document commissioned by Donald Rumsfeld and entitled the National Defense Strategy of the United States of America, warned against the use of lawfare: \"Our strength as a nation state will continue to be challenged by those who employ a strategy of the weak using international fora, judicial processes, and terrorism.\"  The Bush administration thus associated legal threats to US state violence with terrorism.<br>\n<br>\nThe Israeli government has also been increasingly alarmed by the deployment of lawfare. Already in 2001, Ariel Sharon, Israeli Foreign Minister at the time, was indicted by a Belgian court in relation to the well-known war crimes committed against Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Chatila camps in Beirut in 1982.  Since then, news reports have suggested that scores of law suits have been submitted against Israeli politicians, high ranking military officers and heads of secret services in several states.  While none of these suits has actually led to a conviction, the Israeli government has assigned experts in international law to accompany combat military units and has advised former-politicians and military officers to refrain from travelling to certain European countries.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, government officials alongside staff-members from NGOs and think-tanks and a number of academics have spent time examining more closely the suits filed against Israelis.  Not surprisingly, they have found that the reports published by human rights NGOs are frequently cited as incriminating evidence. Writing for Bar Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, Elizabeth Samson, an attorney specializing in international law and constitutional law, contends that those who deploy lawfare \"are not fighting an occupier or challenging a military incursion - they are fighting the forces of freedom, they are fighting the voice of reason, and they are attacking those who have the liberty to speak and act openly.\" The weapon that the enemy is using, Samson continues, \"was created by our own hands- that is the rule of law, a weapon designed to subdue dictators and tyrants is now being misused to empower the very same, and being manipulated to subvert real justice and indisputable truth.\" <br>\n<br>\nLaw becomes lawfare, and human rights a menace, precisely when they are deployed against dominant states and their agents. It is then that law is accompanied with the suffix \"fare\" and suddenly perceived to be a violent force and a threat.<br>\n<br>\nLeading the lawfare campaign against Israel are what NGO Monitor calls \"NGO superpowers\" such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, who in cooperation with liberal Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups resort to universal jurisdiction to pursue litigation in European, North American or Israel's national court. While these NGOs claim to be part of the fight for human rights, the evidence shows, in NGO Monitor's opinion, that the core motivation for this activity is to \"punish Israel for carrying out anti-terror operations.\" <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Legal Terrorism</strong><br>\n<br>\nWhile government officials criticized Israeli human rights organizations ever since they appeared on the political stage in the late 1980s, the effort to constitute them as a security threat gained momentum with the publication of the Goldstone Report, authored by the United Nations Commission that investigated alleged Israeli and Palestinian violations of international law during the 2009 Gaza War.  A few hours after the Report was published, NGO Monitor issued a press release characterizing it as an NGO \"cut and paste\" document.  The claim was that a considerable amount of the findings were based on reports and testimonies provided by biased human rights organizations, several of them Israeli.<br>\n<br>\nWithin two days the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded, claiming that the Goldstone Report \"ties the hands of democratic countries fighting terror worldwide; calls into question the legitimacy of national legal systems and investigations; [and] promotes criminal proceedings against forces confronting terrorism in foreign states and tries to expand the jurisdiction of the ICC beyond its Statute.\" <br>\n<br>\nDanny Ayalon, Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister at the time, used a lawfare metaphor to describe the situation, claiming that \"today the trenches are in Geneva in the Council of Human Rights, or in New York in the General Assembly, or in the Security Council, or in the Hague, the ICJ.\"  To mark human rights day in 2010, Ayalon denounced the human rights misappropriations by liberal NGOs and in a joint press conference held with representatives from NGO Monitor, he claimed that the \"international human rights day has been transformed into terror rights day.\"<br>\n<br>\nForeign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's party, Yisrael Beiteinu, went on to propose creating national committees of inquiry to investigate human rights groups that delegitimize Israel and abet terror.   Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended up not supporting the initiative, he told the cabinet that while the law establishing such committees was important, \"we have to act cautiously and wisely... and prevent further de-legitimization of Israel.\" The notion that Israeli rights groups support terrorism was, however, taken up by the Israeli colonel in charge of the military's international law department, who averred that war crimes charges brought abroad against Israeli soldiers and officers involved in Operation Cast Lead are nothing but \"legal terrorism.\"     <br>\n<br>\nThe reports, policy briefs, press releases, and governmental statements that were put out by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the military, NGOs, think tanks and public intellectuals rapidly coalesced into a doctrine about lawfare and how it constitutes a national threat. By November 2010, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a long report entitled \"The Campaign to Defame Israel,\" where it asserted that: \"The strategy to delegitimize Israel using legal frameworks, and exploiting both international and national legal forums, was adopted following numerous failed military attempts to destroy the Jewish state.\" <br>\n<br>\nThe Ministry proceeded to explain that lawfare has been used by individuals and groups who file criminal and civil law suits in national and international legal forums against prominent military and government figures for alleged violations of international law. \"The number of law suits that have been filed against Israeli officials has grown exponentially in recent years...This form of lawfare does not simply impede Israeli travel plans\" but aims \"to intimidate officials from acting out of fear of prosecution, and in fact impacts foreign relations, strains international ties, and serves to delegitimize the Jewish state... It must be recognized that just as German military theorist Carl von Clausewitz states that 'war is...a continuation of political activity by other means,' so too, lawfare is a continuation of terrorist activity by other means.\" <br>\n<br>\nThe Ministry's logic is straightforward: lawfare is a form of terrorism; human rights NGOs are lawfare enablers; hence, human rights NGOs are part of the terrorism network.<br>\n<br>\n<center>_______________</center><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNicola Perugini is Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Italian Studies and Middle East Studies at Brown University and co-author with Neve Gordon of <em>The Human Right to Dominate</em> (2015, Oxford University Press).

As a recent example, in the context of the debate over investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) in the TTIP, Chief U.S. negotiator Dan Mullaney <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ttip-chief-negotiator-isds-proposal-being-finalized/\">said</a> the United States has already revamped its ISDS system in a way that addresses concerns about \"impartiality and the right of regulators to regulate in the public interest.\"  <br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately, the term \"right to regulate\" is misleading, as it glosses over key distinctions in how international economic law rules affect domestic regulation. It is true that such international rules do affect regulation; but they do so in much more nuanced ways than the debate acknowledges, and the nuances are important here. In simple terms, international rules may identify and prohibit one particular policy goal (e.g., protectionism) that regulations might pursue; or, in the alternative, they may hold every policy goal open to review under a broader standard that gives international courts significant oversight power. It is this distinction that holds the key to the debate, but it is often ignored.<br>\n<br>\nOne of the core functions of international law is to impose constraints on states, requiring them to do, or not do, certain things. Thus, by its nature, international law affects domestic actions, including regulation. The question for the trade policy debate is: how does international economic law affect domestic regulation? It does so in a variety of ways, each with its own particular impact.<br>\n<br>\nThe most important way is that it prohibits governments from adopting regulations that discriminate against foreign goods, services, or investments based on their nationality. For example, governments can adopt environmental regulations that promote greater fuel efficiency. In doing so, however, they cannot impose higher standards on the equivalent cars produced abroad. In other words, they cannot use domestic regulation as a disguised means of giving an advantage to domestic producers.<br>\n<br>\nDoes such a rule interfere with the ability of governments to regulate? Of course it does, as it prohibits an entire category of regulation: protectionist regulations. Protectionist regulation is banned, and governments give up all rights to pursue it (subject to various exceptions and carve-outs). But most people feel such an intrusion into domestic regulation is justified, because protectionism is terrible economics and bad for international relations. As a result, an antidiscrimination rule works well as an international economic law concept, even though it interferes with domestic regulation. It only interferes slightly, and it allows any regulation that is not protectionist.<br>\n<br>\nAlong the same lines, some rules require transparency in domestic regulation.  These rules also intrude on regulation in fairly uncontroversial ways, for example, by requiring publication of regulations.<br>\n<br>\nOther rules, however, cause more concern.  One example is trade rules that prohibit regulations that, while they do not discriminate, are \"more trade restrictive than necessary.\" This standard considers whether regulations hinder trade too much, and also the degree to which they achieve their stated goals. Another example is investment rules that require regulations to be \"fair and equitable,\" sometimes including an examination of whether the regulations are arbitrary. Such rules impose broad and vague constraints on how governments may act, and they do so in ways that are not very clear to regulators. Is a particular regulation protectionist? Regulators and observers generally know the answer to that question at the time the regulation is adopted. By contrast, is a regulation arbitrary? Opinions vary considerably, and we do not know for sure until an international court weighs in on the question.<br>\n<br>\nMore importantly, the broader international rules intrude on every category of regulation. They do not simply classify one particular policy goal (protectionism) that regulations might pursue as off limits.  Rather, they hold every policy goal open to review under a standard that gives international courts a good deal of leeway in their review of the regulation.<br>\n<br>\nTalk of \"rights\" can be unproductive when carried out with a lack of precision, and that is what is going on here. When domestic regulation intersects with international economic law, the underlying issue is the scope and extent of the constraints imposed by international law, and the allocation of power between the national and the international. International law can certainly interfere with the ability of governments to regulate; indeed, that might be the point of it. But different international law rules interfere in different ways. If narrowly drawn (anti-protectionism), they do not interfere much at all; if written broadly (non-arbitrary regulations), they interfere a lot. If we fail to distinguish between the two, we get a confused and unhelpful debate, with people talking past each other. How international economic law affects the ability of governments to regulate is an important question to deal with. Let's not obscure it by referring vaguely to a \"right to regulate,\" without addressing the nuances of the issue. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>","categories":[]},{"title":"North Korea Not Interested In Iran-Like Nuclear Deal","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/21/north-korea-iran-nuclear-deal_n_7839824.html","author":"Charlotte Alfred","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 05:42:10 -0700","contentSnippet":"\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea said Tuesday that it's not interested in an Iran-type nuclear disarmament deal, saying ...","content":"<br>\n<p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea said Tuesday that it's not interested in an Iran-type nuclear disarmament deal, saying it won't abandon its atomic weapons as long as the United States maintains hostile policies toward the country.</p><br>\n<p>The North's nuclear deterrent is \"not a plaything to be put on the negotiating table,\" an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.

Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage throughout the United States -- illustrate a dynamic that has been worrying the international LGBT community for years now: As American evangelicals lose traction at home, they are increasingly finding receptive audiences abroad. Advocates on both sides of the aisle predict the Supreme Court’s ruling will bolster evangelicals&#39; efforts against LGBT rights overseas. </p><br>\n<p>&quot;If you live in the United States, it’s easy to be lulled into thinking that the battle for broader civil rights for gay people is nearly over,&quot; Rev. Dr. Kapya Kaoma, a researcher with Political Research Associates, a think tank focused on the American conservative movement, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kaoma-uganda-gays-american-ministers-20140323-story.html\">wrote in an op-ed last year</a>.</p><br>\n<p>&quot;But not only is that far from true here, in many other parts of the world the culture wars have only just begun as the most ardent U.S. culture warrior’s vitriol is finding a far more receptive audience abroad,&quot; Kaoma, who is also the author of <em>American Culture Warriors in Africa, </em>﻿continued.</p><br>\n<p>In a forthcoming opinion piece for <a href=\"http://religiondispatches.org/\">Religion Dispatches</a>, Kaoma outlines African leaders&#39; responses to the Supreme Court ruling. </p><br>\n<p>&quot;As long as they continue to promote their false framework of homosexuality being an attack on Christianity, wherein the Supreme Court ruling is a supposed precursor to the West forcing the &#39;gay agenda&#39; on Africa, many Africans will continue to find such propaganda attractive,&quot; he writes. </p><br>\n<p>This phenomenon is not confined to African countries. On Friday, Koama joined a group of advocates and researchers from around the world for a panel discussion at Netroots Nation about how American anti-LGBT activists are contributing to the globalization of homophobia. These evangelicals have helped build support for anti-gay laws not only in Africa but also in Russia, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean and South America, the panelists said.</p><br>\n<p>While Christian conservatives are positioning themselves in the United States as a persecuted minority that deserves the right to refrain from participating in same-sex weddings, they are taking a different approach abroad.</p><br>\n<p>&quot;In the United States, as they’ve lost public opinion and now the marriage battle, they’re sort of saying &#39;all we want is to live and let live,&#39;&quot; said Peter Montgomery,  the senior fellow at progressive advocacy group People For the American Way who organized the panel.</p><br>\n<p>&quot;But they don’t want live and let live,&quot; he continued. &quot;Around the world they’re supporting laws that make LGBT people criminals and in some cases even supporting laws that make LGBT advocacy illegal.&quot;</p><br>\n<p>The most famous proponent of this strategy is Scott Lively of Abiding Truth Ministries, who has written such anti-gay books as <em>7 Steps to Recruit-Proof Your Child</em> and stated <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/profiles/scott-lively\">that</a> &quot;there is no question that homosexuality figures prominently in the history of the Holocaust.&quot;</p><br>\n<p>Lively was one of three American evangelicals who gave a series of high-profile talks in Uganda in 2009 linking homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality. A month after his visit, some of the lawmakers and government officials he had met with released a draft of Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2009, which called for the execution of gay people by hanging. Lively has been sued by a gay-rights group for alleged &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; related to his work in Uganda, and is scheduled to be called upon this fall to defend his practices as he stands trial in a U.S. federal court. He also conducted a 50-city tour in the former Soviet Union in 2006 and 2007, during which he warned people about the perils of homosexuality. </p><br>\n<p>Lively is among those who see the Supreme Court ruling as boon to American evangelicals seeking to extend their influence abroad. In an email to The Huffington Post, he wrote that the ruling will \"strengthen the resolve of the international pro-family movement to pass legislation opposing LGBT radicalism in various countries around the world.\"</p><br>\n<p>Lively added that he thought American progressives may come to regret the ruling. \"We may even see push-back from some progressives who will likely eventually start to recognize and value the natural family as humanity's eco-system and move to protect it in the same manner they currently work to protect other threatened eco-systems,\" he said.</p><br>\n<p>Gillian Kane, another panelist and researcher with Political Research Associates, said it was too early to see just how the Supreme Court ruling would shape the international anti-gay movement but that she also anticipated backlash to the decision. </p><br>\n<p>&quot;What’s notable is that they have all their pieces in place,&quot; she told HuffPost. &quot;There’s going to be a backlash, but the backlash is enabled because they’ve already developed their overseas partners, they’ve had the litigation, they’re ready to go into action.&quot;</p><br>\n<p>Kane released a <a href=\"http://www.politicalresearch.org/2015/07/13/latin-america-in-the-crosshairs-alliance-defending-freedom-takes-aim/#sthash.ga7eGdDd.g3MlvpPQ.dpuf\">report</a> last week on the rapidly expanding presence of the Alliance Defending Freedom -- a Christian advocacy and litigation firm founded in 1994 by several of the United States largest evangelical ministries -- in South America.

I’ll read just about anything, but most of the books I pick up fall into a Venn diagram: there are books that make my mind whirr endlessly, sparking meditation on late nights for long hours on something that exists outside of its plot (recently, <em>The Small Backs of Children</em> by Lidia Yuknavitch); books that sweep me up in their pleasurable wish-fulfillment (recently, <em>Grey</em> by E.L. James); and books that accomplish both of those things (recently, <em>Find Me</em> by Laura van den Berg). Where a book falls in this diagram isn’t strictly genre-dependent, nor is the age of a story’s narrator a factor, but the distinction exists in my mind nevertheless.</span></p><br>\n<p><span>In my experiences reading YA books as an adult, they’ve fulfilled wishes, allowing me to pleasurably re-embody an idealistic yet naive mindset. Though I saw their value as educational tools and emotional road maps for kids, I didn’t believe they offered nuanced views of the world fit for grown-ups. Teen-centric stories didn’t live in the center of my reader’s venn diagram. But reading <em>Paper Towns</em> forced me to reconsider that.</span></p><br>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span>***</span> </p><br>\n<p><span>Young Adult literature’s lack of mature insight, according to Graham, is rooted in a supposed aversion to messy, unresolved stories. To explain this, she points to the narrator of <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>, a 17-year-old with terminal cancer who’s obsessed with uncovering the ending to a novel by a revered writer, who notoriously left the story hanging mid-sentence, providing no catharsis for readers. </span></p><br>\n<p><span>But <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> is more self-aware than its protagonist is when we meet her. The novel is about her coming to grips with life’s messiness and opting for hope in the face of random despair. </span></p><br>\n<p><span><em>Paper Towns</em> has a similar message. What begins as a neat adventure, wherein a lovesick narrator travels cross-country in search of a wild, super-fun “cool girl,” unfolds into a deep meditation on hope, expectation and the ways we can and can’t connect with each other.</span> </p><br>\n<p><span>Its central characters are Quentin “Q” Jacobsen and the beautiful, spontaneous object of his desire, Margo Roth Spiegelman. Their names alone are twee enough to turn off readers who yearn for stories packed with the travails of Real Life, but stay with me. They were friends as kids, united by a traumatizing event that Q’s parents handle gracefully, but Margo’s parents fail to address adequately. That’s where their paths diverge -- Q becomes a well-adjusted, reserved, college-bound quiet kid; Margo a living legend, always rumored to be cooking up wild pranks and adventures on her quest for meaning. Q remarks that she’s awesome “in the literal sense,” but they’re mostly estranged -- until she shows up in his bedroom window asking to borrow his car.</span> </p><br>\n<p><span>A night of prank-pulling and general subversiveness (they break into SeaWorld! They break into other buildings!) sets off a Sal Paradise-esque emotional awakening in once-vanilla Q, and the two prattle off Pinterest-worthy quotes about the meaning of life that are a little cringe-inducing to non-teens, but no less so than Sal’s desire to “burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles.”</span></p><br>\n<p><span>But, unlike <em>On the Road</em> (which, it’s worth noting, I adored in high school but can’t reread today because its inspired, myopic anthem no longer resonates), <em>Paper Towns</em> doesn’t conclude with the power of burn, burning. When the enchanting Margo disappears the day after their whirlwind evening, an enamored Q tries to find her with a string of clues she left behind and on the way learns that his conception of her was narrow, self-centered and childish. Her wild ways, he comes to learn, don’t pour from a magical well inside of her. Instead, she feels empty -- as so many teens without an adopted ideology must -- and is hodge-podging a personality as best she can. </span></p><br>\n<p>Q learns about Margo’s inner life -- a manic pixie dream girl she is not, if such a thing even exists -- through the notes she’s left behind, in books and elsewhere. Highlighted passages from Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> tip him off to an abandoned building where she spent nights alone, planning her disappearance. Of all of Whitman’s words, she selects these as her mantra:</p><br>\n<blockquote><br>\n<p><span>“You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,</span></p><br>\n<p><span>But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,</span></p><br>\n<p><span>And filter and fibre your blood”</span></p><br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<p> <br>Puzzled, Q turns to his English teacher for advice, and their exchange could serve as the novel’s thesis, as well as a defense of the value of teen books in general. She asks whether Q’s looked at the wider world of the novel, whether he’s read the whole thing for context. He confesses:</p><br>\n<blockquote><br>\n<p><span>“Mostly I just read the parts she highlighted. I’m reading it to understand Margo, not to understand Whitman.”</span></p><br>\n<p><span>[...]</span></p><br>\n<p><span>“I think that’s precisely what Whitman would’ve wanted. For you to see <em>Song of Myself </em>not just as a poem but as a way into understanding another.”</span></p><br>\n</blockquote><br>\n<p> <br>Whitman’s quest to embody the grass; Q’s quest to embody Margo, and by doing so discover where she’s hiding; the reader’s quest to embody them both; they’re all a practice in empathy, which is what literature is all about. John Green is acutely aware of this, and so crafts a book about teens as adult-worthy as any other. He takes the stereotypes our stories of youth are rife with, cracks them open, and reassembles them into something fractured but true.</p><br>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span>***</span></p><br>\n<p><span><em>Paper Towns</em> is a more self-aware novel than <em>On the Road</em> and other such youthful musings. Which isn’t to say one book is better than the other. What <em>On the Road</em> lacks in apparent critical distance it more than makes up for in its immediacy, its beautiful lyricism, its words rich with texture. What <em>Paper Towns</em> lacks in steadily poetic language it makes up for in a cerebral nerdiness. It constantly comments on itself and its plot; it knowingly and cheekily busts tropes.</span> </p><br>\n<p><span>What separates the two, I believe, is that one is hopeful, the other cynical. And that maybe is an accurate dichotomy to apply to all realistic novels. While adult literature confronts life’s messiness by throwing up its hands, YA books tend to offer bravery as a solution. In general, this approach to life could be called naivety. But Green’s characters know what they’re up against -- they just opt for optimism anyway. As Q concludes, “maybe we can imagine these futures by making them real, and maybe not, but either way we must imagine them.”</span></p><br>\n<p><em>Also on HuffPost:</em></p><br>\n <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>","categories":[]},{"title":"Greece Submits Bill Needed To Start Bailout Rescue Talks","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/21/greece-debt-crisis-talks_n_7839694.html","author":"Nick Robins-Early","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 05:30:27 -0700","contentSnippet":"ATHENS, July 21 (Reuters) - The Greek government submitted legislation to parliament on Tuesday required by its international ...","content":"<p>ATHENS, July 21 (Reuters) - The Greek government submitted legislation to parliament on Tuesday required by its international lenders to start talks on a multi-billion euro rescue package.</p><br>\n<div><br>\n<p>Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has until Wednesday night to get those measures adopted in the assembly.

For the next 9 weeks we will be counting up to number 1.</em><br>\n<br>\nIn life, we all need a horse to ride. Without the horse, we are a small fraction of what we could be.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I was 13, my parents took me to a motor museum at a grand country house. Big yawn. Happily, there was a donkey derby alongside it, and they agreed to let me ride a donkey. Being bigger and heavier than the other kids, nobody backed me and the bookmakers pushed my odds out to 66-1 against. Whereupon my dad surprised them by plonking down a fiver on me -- after a moment's hesitation, the bookie took the bet and rubbed out 66-1 and put 25-1 instead.<br>\n<br>\nWhen the race started, I was so terrified of falling off that I stuck my heels into my donkey and held on for dear life. The donkey was terrified too -- he moved up three gears and we won drawing away. Dad was £330 richer -- a fortune then.<br>\n<br>\nI tried to get the same donkey in the next race but the ring manager directed me to another one, perhaps feeling that two rides from me would be hard on the beast. This time I was less scared but I couldn't galvanize the nag and we finished a distant third, even though the punters had piled their money on me and we had started odds-on.<br>\n<br>\nGuess which donkey won? The one I'd been on the first race. It was a sign!<br>\n<br>\nWe are all less important than the donkey -- or preferably horse -- we get to ride. Life is not just you or me -- it is the vehicle (or vehicles) we find to develop our skills and express ourselves that counts. And even then, perhaps our skills matter little compared to the destiny of the horse.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I was 30, I was more-or-less fired from one job (with the Boston Consulting Group) but talked my way into another with a smaller rival, Bain &amp; Company. But the thing was -- Bain had a great business formula and was growing much faster, at 40 percent a year. Yes, each year the firm got 40 percent bigger. You can imagine the opportunities presented by that growth rate. From being a failure I turned into an overnight success -- doing exactly the same job. It wasn&#39;t me, it was the growth rate. I was stretched, learned a lot and became so much more confident. I even started to enjoy what I did.<br>\n<br>\nThe horse, not the jockey.<br>\n<br>\nWhen I became a writer, I pondered the 80/20 principle. I had long known its value. I was not the only one. The principle was well known to economists and in business circles and was much discussed on the web. But no one had written a book about it. Now that book has sold over a million copies.<br>\n<br>\nThe book, not the writer.<br>\nThe horse, not the rider.<br>\nHave you found your horse yet?<br>\n<br>\nThe horse could be a college or firm that transforms you. It could be an idea. It could be a new business venture. It could be a church, a club, or a cause you make your own. It could be a group of friends banded together to do something great. If you want to transform your life, find your horse. But how?<br>\n<br>\n<strong>How to Find Your Horse</strong><br>\nThe horse, you will recall, is something with inherent power to propel you. It could be a college or organization, a job, a new business venture, a cause, an idea, or a group of friends fixated on one specific aim. These horses are rare. There are three secrets to tracking them down.<br>\nThe easiest give-away is that the horse is young, yet fast and powerful. It is growing rapidly. Its time has come, but only just.<br>\n<br>\nIf the horse is a business, it will be growing by more than 10 percent a year, and probably between 30-50 percent a year, maybe even more. Such firms are very unusual -- somewhere between one and five in a hundred. Yet if we you keep your eyes open, you will find such a firm.<br>\n<br>\nThe firm must be growing under its own steam. Firms that grow by merger or acquisition do not count. What does it mean if the business is expanding fast? It means it has created a product or service that people really want. It means the firm has a formula or business model or knowledge that other firms don't have. It means the business is a winner.<br>\n<br>\nEvery very large and profitable firm started life like this -- initially it was tiny, and then it went through several years of incredibly quick growth. If you go to work in such a business, you will benefit enormously because there is more opportunity in the firm than experienced workers. You will spread your wings and learn to fly like an angel. You work will be fascinating and you will get promoted rapidly. If you can get stock options, you may end up with a fortune. Ask the first 100 people into Microsoft, Google, Amazon, e-Bay, Twitter, Facebook, or any other mega-success. They are all millionaires, centi-millionaries, or billionaires; not because they are smarter than you or me, but because they were there at the start or shortly after.<br>\n<br>\nIt's the same for a cause, a social movement, or even a qualification. If it's not growing very fast, it won't push you forward. In the 1960s and 1970s, it made sense to get an MBA, because there weren't many around and business schools were mushrooming. Now it's futile to do an MBA -- there are far too many already and the currency is devalued. Instead, look for the next big thing. Get in early, while the growth is exponential.<br>\n<br>\nThe second clue to finding your horse is that it excites you. The idea, the cause, the organization, whatever it is, must turn you on and have meaning for you. You must think, \"I love the idea of this,\" or \"I am going to grow to love this.\" Animation, enthusiasm, and genuine fervor are peculiarly human attributes. They too are rare. Most people are not excited by life and what they do. The few who are, have a tremendous edge. They are tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more likely to succeed -- and they will have a ball doing so, not least because every day they will collaborate with people who are as excited and motivated as they are.<br>\n<br>\nThe third pointer is that the horse has integrity. Everything about the horse hangs together. The horse is beautiful. The horse is admirable and excellent. The horse is generous. The horse doesn't have bad breath, a gamy leg, or a hidden disease. If the horse is an idea, the idea is true and constructive. If the horse is a firm, it has a mission to improve the world in some well-defined and narrow way, and everything about the firm is designed to fulfil that mission. And if the horse is a cause, the cause has to benefit society at large, not just its proponents. With any beautiful horse, there is always some deeply satisfying insight behind the idea, the firm, or the cause -- an insight that is unusual or unique, and thoroughly worthwhile.<br>\n<br>\nIn large parts of Europe in the 1920s and early 1930s, there were two horses growing faster than any other. One horse was the Communist Party and the other horse was the Nazis. Both horses excited their devotees. Both horses were immensely strong. But neither of them had integrity. The ideas they espoused were simply not true. The horses were speckled with evil. It is the same with every get-rich-quick scam, every witch-hunt, every mean and nasty movement. One of the most amazing and hopeful things about the universe is that evil does not last, because it cannot embody the spiritual longing of humans, the thirst for truth and beauty. Only ideas, firms, causes and people with integrity can build something wonderful and enduring.<br>\n<br>\nSo there it is. To find your horse, recall three words -- growth, excitement and integrity. Finding your horse will not be easy. But if you think hard and look hard, if you really are consumed with desire for such a horse, it will come to you. You will attract it. You will recognize it immediately, with overflowing joy. The horse will change your life, and that of many other people. <p>-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html/\">terms.</a> It may be used for personal consumption, but may not be distributed on a website.</p>","categories":[]},{"title":"The Bottom Line: 'The Small Backs Of Children' By Lidia Yuknavitch","link":"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/16/the-small-backs-of-children-lidia-yuknavitch_n_7839670.html","author":"Maddie Crum","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 05:27:39 -0700","contentSnippet":"\nA vulture looms over a wisp of a child, curled up and limp.

It’s a striking image, taken during a Sudanese famine in the &#39;90s; so striking that the photographer, Kevin Carter, won the Pulitzer Prize for taking it. Not long after, he committed suicide. Some say the horrors he witnessed abroad were responsible for the tragedy.</p><br>\n<p>Before his death, Carter was criticized for opting to frame a photo rather than assist its starving subject. Questions were raised about the ethics of war reporting, not least among them: does raising awareness actually contribute to a solution?</p><br>\n<p><span>In her new novel, <em>The Small Backs of Children</em>, Lidia Yuknavitch creates a similar character, a photographer who by chance snaps a perfectly emotive image of a girl in Eastern Europe, where there’s violence without war, persistent but unacknowledged elsewhere.</span></p><br>\n<p><span>The novel begins the moment after the shutter clicks, and follows the child subject as she races into the woods, away from an explosion that’s killed her mother, father and brother. The girl has morbid run-ins with soldiers and eventually happens upon an older woman, widowed as a result of their country’s unstable state. The girl is nurtured back to physical and mental health; she begins painting; she learns English.</span></p><br>\n<p>But the rest of the world associates her with a different image: flying forward from the power of the bomb, her face frozen in horror, her body arrested midair. By delving into the messy depths and possible outcomes of her life after the half-second shot is frozen in time, published, disseminated and awarded the highest prizes, Yuknavitch is rebelling against the clean, swift straightforwardness of plot, and the monolithic representation of truth presented by a work of art.</p><br>\n<p><span>This mode of storytelling is unsurprising coming from Yuknavitch, whose memoir <em>The Chronology of Water</em> infuses seemingly concrete experiences -- competitive swimming, sexual awakenings -- with fluid language that undulates between themes. In an interview with The Rumpus, <a href=\"http://therumpus.net/2015/07/the-rumpus-interview-with-lidia-yuknavitch-2/\">the author makes her views clear</a>: “the membrane between fiction and nonfiction is thin as infant’s skin.”</span></p><br>\n<p><span><em>The Small Backs of Children</em> doesn’t move ahead like most narratives. Instead, its events are related by a cast of characters, whose connected lives form a helluva family tree: the young subject of the above mentioned photograph; the photographer, an aging bisexual woman grappling with the stark truths presented in her chosen craft; the writer, who falls ill while penning a novel about the girl from the photo, leaving the storytelling up to her peers; the filmmaker and writer&#39;s husband; the artist, her spurious, cadlike ex-husband; the playwright, her brother, who fled their abusive upbringing; the performance artist, a pixielike girl with a broken heart; and the poet, a jet-setting dominatrix. Each narrator tells his or her portion of the story using language fitting for their respective vocations -- the filmmaker, for example, is sentimental and focused on the appearance of things.</span></p><br>\n<p><span>Together, the cast decides to travel to Eastern Europe to rescue the girl from the now-renowned photo. Unaware that the girl has created a pleasant life for herself, they believe they are saving her, that they&#39;re championing altruism over art. </span></p><br>\n<p>Yuknavitch isn&#39;t entirely critical of their self-righteousness, or of their subtle cultural appropriation. She concludes her story with the girl meditating on the same ideas artists have pondered for centuries, aiding trauma with a swishing brush.“Where do we come from?&quot; she wonders. &quot;Is it a country? A mother? Or is it perhaps an image, a song ... ?” </p><br>\n<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong></p><br>\n<p><em>﻿The Small Backs of Children</em> beautifully examines the fractures of loss and the myriad ways we can recover from it. </p><br>\n<p><strong>Who wrote it?</strong></p><br>\n<p>﻿Lidia Yuknavitch teaches writing in Portland, Oregon. She's the author of <em>Dora: A Headcase</em> and <em>The Chronology of Water</em>, a memoir. </p><br>\n<p><strong><span>Who will read it?</span></strong></p><br>\n<p>﻿Those interested in cerebral narrators, philosophical stories and the impact war has on a country&#39;s citizens. </p><br>\n<p><strong>Opening lines:</strong></p><br>\n<p><strong>﻿</strong>﻿\"You must picture your image of Eastern Europe. In your mind's eye. Whatever that image is. However it came to you. Winter.
