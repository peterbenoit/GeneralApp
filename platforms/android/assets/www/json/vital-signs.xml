longer respond to the drugs designed to kill them. Inappropriate
prescribing of antibiotics and lack of infection control actions
can contribute to drug resistance and put patients at risk for
deadly diarrhea (caused by <em>C. difficile</em>). Even if one
facility is following recommended infection controls, germs can be
spread inside of and between health care facilities when patients
are transferred from one health care facility to another without
appropriate actions to stop spread. Lack of coordination between
facilities can put patients at increased risk. Now more than ever
is the time for public health authorities and health care
facilities to work together, sharing experiences and connecting
patient safety efforts happening across the state.</p><h4>Health care facility CEOs/administrators can:</h4><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Implement systems to alert receiving facilities when
transferring patients who have drug-resistant germs.</li><li>Review and perfect infection control actions within your
facility.</li><li>Get leadership commitment to join healthcare-associated

facilities.</h4><h5>Antibiotic resistance is a threat.</h5><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Nightmare germs called CRE (carbapenem-resistant
<em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>) can cause deadly infections and have
become resistant to all or nearly all antibiotics we have today.
CRE spread between health care facilities like hospitals and
nursing homes when appropriate actions are not taken.</li><li>MRSA (methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>)
infections commonly cause pneumonia and sepsis that can be
deadly.</li><li>The germ <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> can cause HAIs,
including bloodstream infections. Strains resistant to almost all
antibiotics have been found in hospitalized patients.</li><li>These germs are some of the most deadly resistant germs
identified as "urgent" and "serious" threats.</li></ul><h5> <em>C. difficile</em> infections are at historically
high rates.</h5><ul class=" list-bullet"><li><em>C. difficile (Clostridium difficile)</em>, a germ commonly
found in health care facilities, can be picked up from contaminated
surfaces or spread from a healthcare provider's hands.</li><li>Most <em>C. difficile</em> is not resistant to antibiotics, but
when a person takes antibiotics, some good germs are destroyed.
Antibiotic use allows <em>C. difficile</em> to take over, putting
patients at high risk for deadly diarrhea.</li></ul><h5>Working together is vital.</h5><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Infections and antibiotic use in one facility affect other
facilities because of patient transfers.</li><li>Public health leadership is critical so that facilities are
alerted to data about resistant infections, <em>C. difficile</em>,
or outbreaks in the area, and can target effective prevention
strategies.</li><li>When facilities are alerted to increased threat levels, they
can improve antibiotic use and infection control actions so that
patients are better protected.</li><li>National efforts to prevent infections and improve antibiotic
prescribing could prevent 619,000 antibiotic-resistant and <em>C.
difficile</em> infections over 5 years.</li></ul><p class="margin-top-ten"><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/stop-spread/infographic.html#graphic"><img class="" alt="Graphic: " src="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/stop-spread/images/graphic-a920px.jpg" /></a></p><p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/stop-spread/infographic.html#graphic">View large image and text

age groups, and all income levels. Some of the greatest increases
occurred in demographic groups with historically low rates of
heroin use: women, the privately insured, and people with higher
incomes. Not only are people using heroin, they are also abusing
multiple other substances, especially cocaine and prescription
opioid painkillers. As heroin use has increased, so have
heroin-related overdose deaths. Between 2002 and 2013, the rate of
heroin-related overdose deaths nearly quadrupled, and more than
8,200 people died in 2013. States play a central role in
prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts for this growing
epidemic.</p><h4>States can:</h4><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Address the strongest risk factor for heroin addiction:
addiction to prescription opioid painkillers.</li><li>Increase access to substance abuse treatment services,
including Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT), for opioid
addiction.</li><li>Expand access to and training for administering naloxone to
reduce opioid overdose deaths.</li><li>Ensure that people have access to integrated prevention
services, including access to sterile injection equipment from a
reliable source, as allowed by local policy.</li><li>Help local jurisdictions to put these effective practices to
work in communities where drug addiction is common.</li></ul><p>Want to learn more?

2011, there were more than 65,000 cases of melanoma, the most
deadly form of skin cancer. Melanoma can spread to other parts of
the body and causes over 9,000 deaths every year. People who die of
melanoma lose an average of 20 years of life expectancy. Melanoma
can be caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from
sun or sources such as indoor tanning. Without additional
prevention efforts, melanoma will continue to increase in the next
15 years. Communities and policy makers play a major role in these
skin cancer prevention efforts.</p><p><strong>Communities and policymakers can:</strong></p><ul><li>Increase shade at playgrounds, public pools, and other public
spaces.</li><li>Promote sun protection in recreation areas, including the use
or purchase of hats, sunscreen, and sunglasses.</li><li>Encourage employers, childcare centers, schools, and colleges
to educate employees and students about sun safety and skin
protection.</li><li>Restrict the availability and use of indoor tanning by
minors.</li></ul><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="problem" name="problem" title="Problem"></a></div></div></div><div class="syndicate" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="mSyndicate"><div class="module-typeA"><h3>Problem</h3><div><h4>Melanoma is increasing.</h4><p><strong>Melanoma skin cancer is common and costly.</strong></p><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>People of any skin color can get skin cancer and people with

annual treatment costs for all cancers combined.</li><li>The annual cost of treating new melanoma patients is projected
to triple from 2011 through 2030 (from $457 million to $1.6

Reversible Contraception (LARC), are the most effective types of
birth control for teens. LARC is safe to use, does not require
taking a pill each day or doing something each time before having
sex, and can prevent pregnancy for 3 to 10 years, depending on the
method. Less than 1% of LARC users would become pregnant during the

		<summary><![CDATA[No level of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is safe. SHS exposure occurs when nonsmokers breathe in smoke exhaled by smokers or from burning tobacco products. It kills more than 400 infants and 41,000 adult nonsmokers* every year. Exposure to SHS among US nonsmokers has declined, but progress has not been the same for everyone. SHS exposure is more common among children ages 3 to 11 years, blacks, people living below the poverty level, and those who rent housing.

from exposure to SHS. Half of the US population is covered by state
or local smokefree laws that do not allow indoor smoking in
worksites and public places, including restaurants and bars. Most

and can be exposed to unwanted SHS in their homes. SHS from units

units.</li><li>Many who live in public housing are especially affected by SHS,

the dangers of SHS.</li><li>Not allow anyone to smoke around children and avoid all public
places where smoking is allowed.</li><li>Talk to children about why they shouldn't smoke or be around

of cervical cancers are preventable. Human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination helps prevent infection with the HPV types that cause
most cervical cancers. The Papanicolaou (Pap) test screens for
abnormal cells that may develop into cancer and the HPV test
screens for the HPV virus that causes these cell changes. Even
though screening works, 10% of women in the US in 2012 reported
they had not been screened in the last 5 years. Every visit to
doctors and nurses is an opportunity to discuss cervical cancer
prevention. No woman should die of cervical cancer.</p><h4>Doctors, nurses, and health systems can:</h4><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Help women understand what screening tests are best for them

(ED)—and nearly 200,000 were then hospitalized—for crash injuries
in 2012. On average, each crash-related ED visit costs about $3,300
and each hospitalization costs about $57,000 over a person's
lifetime. The best way to keep people safe and reduce medical costs
is to prevent crashes from happening in the first place. But if a
crash does occur, many injuries can still be avoided through the
use of proven interventions. More can be done at every level to
prevent crashes and reduce injuries, but state-level changes are
especially effective.</p><h3>State officials can:</h3><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Consider using proven interventions that increase the use of
car seats, booster seats, and seat belts; reduce drinking and
driving; and improve teen driver safety.</li><li>Support traffic safety laws with media campaigns and visible
police presence, such as those used with sobriety checkpoints.</li><li>Link medical and crash data to better understand why crashes
happen, the economic cost of those crashes, and how to prevent
future crashes.</li></ul><span><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="problem" name="problem" title="Problem"> </a></span></div></div></div></div><div class="syndicate" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="mSyndicate"><div class="module-typeA"><h3>Problem</h3><div><h4>Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury in the
US—harmful and expensive.</h4><p><strong>What works to prevent crash injuries?</strong></p><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Using primary enforcement seat belt laws that cover everyone in
the car. A primary enforcement law means a police officer can pull
over and ticket a driver or passenger for not wearing a seat belt.
A secondary enforcement law means a police officer can ticket a
driver or passenger for not wearing a seat belt only if the driver
has been pulled over for some other offense.</li><li>Having child passenger restraint laws that require car seat or
booster seat use for children age 8 and under, or until 57 inches
tall, the recommended height for proper seat belt fit.</li><li>Using sobriety checkpoints, where police systematically stop
drivers to check if they are driving under the influence of
alcohol.</li><li>Requiring ignition interlocks for people convicted of drinking
and driving, starting with their first conviction. Ignition
interlocks check and analyze a driver's breath and prevent the car
from starting if alcohol is detected.</li><li>Using comprehensive graduated driver licensing (GDL) systems,
which help new drivers gain skills in low-risk conditions. As
drivers move through the different stages, they receive more
driving privileges, such as driving at night or with passengers.
Every state has GDL, but the specific rules vary.</li></ul><p>Each of these strategies can prevent injuries and save medical
costs. Much has been done to help keep people safe on the road, but
no state has fully implemented all of these proven
interventions.</p><p>Learn more at:

sodium is in the form of salt, as a part of processed foods. A high
sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure. About 1 in 6 children
ages 8-17 years has raised blood pressure. High blood pressure is a
major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Lowering sodium in

to place—not enough to explain why, in 2012, health care providers
in the highest-prescribing state wrote almost 3 times as many
opioid painkiller prescriptions per person as those in the lowest
prescribing state in the US. Or why there are twice as many
painkiller prescriptions per person in the US as in Canada. Data
suggest that where health care providers practice influences how
they prescribe. Higher prescribing of painkillers is associated
with more overdose deaths. More can be done at every level to
prevent overprescribing while ensuring patients' access to safe,
effective pain treatment. Changes at the state level show
particular promise.</p><h3>States can</h3><ul><li>Consider ways to increase use of prescription drug monitoring
programs, which are state-run databases that track prescriptions
for painkillers and can help find problems in overprescribing. Use
of these programs is greater when they make data available in
real-time, are universal (used by all prescribers for all
controlled substances), and are actively managed (for example, send
alerts to prescribers when problems are identified).</li><li>Consider policy options (including laws and regulation)
relating to pain clinics (facilities that specialize in pain
treatment) to reduce prescribing practices that are risky to
patients.</li></ul><p class="smallFontSize">* "Prescription painkillers" refers to

but those account for only about 1% of all reported norovirus
outbreaks. Norovirus is very contagious, and outbreaks can occur
anywhere people gather or food is served. People with norovirus
usually vomit and have diarrhea. Some may need to be hospitalized
and can even die. Infected people can spread norovirus to others
through close contact or by contaminating food and surfaces. Food
service workers who have norovirus can contaminate food and make
many people sick. In norovirus outbreaks for which investigators
reported the source of contamination, 70% are caused by infected
food workers.</p><p><strong>The food service industry can help prevent norovirus
outbreaks by:</strong></p><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Making sure that food service workers practice proper hand
washing and avoid touching ready-to- eat foods, such as raw fruits
and vegetables, with their bare hands before serving them.</li><li>Certifying kitchen managers and training food service workers
in food safety practices.</li><li>Requiring sick food workers to stay home, and considering use
of paid sick leave and on-call staffing, to support
compliance.</li></ul><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="problem" name="problem" title="Problem"></a></div></div></div></div><div class="syndicate" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="mSyndicate"><div class="module-typeA"><h3>Problem</h3><div><h4>Norovirus outbreaks from contaminated food are common in food
service settings.</h4><p><strong>People infected with norovirus are very
contagious.</strong></p><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>While sick, they shed billions of tiny viral particles in their
stool and vomit. It takes a very small amount—as few as 18 viral
particles—to make another person sick. People can get sick if they
are exposed to a tiny amount of stool or vomit from an infected
person.</li><li>They are most contagious when sick with vomiting and diarrhea,
but may also infect others before symptoms start and after they
feel better.</li><li>Because symptoms come on suddenly, an infected person who
vomits in a public place may expose many people.</li></ul><p><strong>Food service workers often go to work when they are sick
and may contaminate food.</strong></p><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>1 in 5 food service workers have reported working while sick
with vomiting and diarrhea. Fear of job loss and leaving coworkers
short staffed were significant factors in their decision.</li><li>Of outbreaks caused by infected food workers, 54% involve food
workers touching ready-to-eat-foods with their bare hands.
Ready-to-eat foods are foods that are ready to be served without
additional preparation, such as washed raw fruits and vegetables
for salads or sandwiches, baked goods, or items that have already
been cooked.</li><li>Observations of food service workers have shown that they
practice proper hand washing only 1 of 4 times that they
should.</li></ul><p><strong>Norovirus is hard to kill and stays on food, kitchen
surfaces, and utensils. It can</strong></p><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Remain infectious on foods even at freezing temperatures and
until heated above 140°F.</li><li>Stay on countertops and serving utensils for up to 2
weeks.</li><li>Resist many common disinfectants and hand sanitizers.</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/norovirus/infographic.html#graphic"><img class="" alt="Most norovirus outbreaks from contaminated food occur in food service settings like restaurants. Just a very small amount of norovirus on your food or your hands can make you sick. The amount of virus particles that fit on the head of a pin would be enough to infect more than 1,000 people.

effective enforcement of all FDA model Food Code provisions,
including worker health and hygiene.</li><li>Funding state and local efforts to detect, respond,
investigate, and report norovirus outbreaks more thoroughly.</li><li>Building lab capacity for advanced molecular detection to
quickly detect and track the source of norovirus outbreaks using
genome sequencing and analysis.</li></ul><h4>State and local governments can</h4><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Adopt and enforce all provisions of the FDA model Food Code to
better safeguard food.</li><li>Investigate norovirus outbreaks thoroughly to identify sources

safety practices.</li><li>Establish policies that require workers to stay home while sick
with vomiting and diarrhea and for at least 48 hours after symptoms
stop.</li><li>Foster a work environment that encourages workers to stay home
when sick, by considering such measures such as paid sick leave and
a staffing plan that includes on-call workers.</li></ul><h4>Food service workers can</h4><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Tell a manager when sick with vomiting and diarrhea.</li><li>Wash hands carefully and often with soap and warm water for at
least 20 seconds (time it takes to sing the "Happy Birthday" song
through twice), especially after using the restroom.</li><li>Use utensils and single-use disposable gloves to avoid touching
ready-to-eat foods with bare hands.</li><li>Regularly clean and sanitize kitchen surfaces and frequently
touched objects, using a chlorinebased product or other sanitizer
approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for use against
norovirus.</li><li>Immediately block off, clean, and disinfect areas where there
has been a vomiting or diarrheal incident.</li><li>Carefully wash fruits and vegetables and avoid serving
undercooked (below 140°F) oysters and other shellfish.</li></ul><h4>Everyone can</h4><ul class=" list-bullet"><li>Wash hands carefully and often with soap and warm water for at
least 20 seconds, and avoid preparing food for others while
sick.</li><li>Report suspected illness from food to your local health
