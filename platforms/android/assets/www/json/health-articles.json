Only you can give your baby protection against whooping cough
before your little one is even born. Talk to your doctor or midwife
about getting the Tdap vaccine during your third
trimester</strong>.</p><p>Whooping cough is a serious disease that can be deadly for
babies. Unfortunately, babies can't get vaccinated and start
building protection against whooping cough until they are two
months old. The good news is that you can avoid this gap in
protection by getting the whooping cough vaccine (called Tdap)
during the third trimester of your pregnancy. By doing so, you pass
antibodies to your baby before birth. These antibodies help protect
your baby in the first few months of life.</p><h3>You Need a Whooping Cough Vaccine during Each Pregnancy</h3><div class=\"pull-right span4\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><img alt=\"Pregnant woman with child and husband\" class=\"margin-right-ten\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/tdap-in-pregnancy/tdap-in-pregnancy_170px.jpg\" /><p>If you are pregnant, you'll need the whooping cough vaccine in
your third trimester.</p></div></div><p>CDC recommends pregnant women get the whooping cough vaccine
between 27 and 36 weeks of each pregnancy. This recommendation is
supported by the 

<a href=\"http://www.immunizationforwomen.org/immunization_facts/vaccine-preventable_diseases/pertussis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to External Web Site\">American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> and the 

<a href=\"http://www.midwife.org/omot-vaccines-during-pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to External Web Site\">American College
of Nurse-Midwives</a>, healthcare professionals who specialize in
caring for pregnant women. The goal is to give babies some
short-term protection against whooping cough in early life.</p><p>The amount of antibodies you have from the whooping cough
vaccine will decrease over time. That is why it's important for
pregnant women to get a whooping cough vaccine during each
pregnancy so that each baby has the benefit of getting the greatest
number of protective antibodies. Getting the whooping cough vaccine
while pregnant is the best way to help protect your baby from
whooping cough in the first few months of life.</p><h3>Whooping Cough Vaccine during Pregnancy Is Safe for Your
Baby</h3><p>Getting the whooping cough vaccine while you are pregnant is
very safe for you and your unborn baby. The most common side
effects include redness, swelling, pain, and tenderness where the
shot is given, body-ache, fatigue, or fever. Severe side effects
are extremely rare. You cannot get whooping cough from the whooping
cough vaccine. Learn more about

rise.</p><p>There are many factors contributing to this increase, but one
key reason is that today's vaccines, while safe and effective, do
not last as long as we would like. However, getting vaccinated is
still the best way to prevent whooping cough and its
complications.</p><p>View the latest

symptoms can be very serious because their immune systems are still
developing. They can get pneumonia (a lung infection), and many
have trouble breathing.</p><p>About half of babies who get whooping cough end up in the
hospital. The younger the baby is when he gets whooping cough, the
more likely it is that he will need to be treated in the hospital.
Every year in the United States, up to 20 babies die from whooping
cough, with most deaths in those too young to be protected by their
own whooping cough vaccine.</p></div></div><div class=\"syndicate\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><div class=\"mSyndicate\"><div class=\"module-typeA\"><h3>More Information</h3><div><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pregnancy

one of the top achievements in the history of public health. But,
because of this success, most young parents have never seen the
devastating effects that diseases like polio, measles, or whooping
cough (pertussis) can have on a family or community. It's easy to
think of these as diseases that only existed in the past. But the
truth is they still exist. Children in the United States can—and
do—still get some of these diseases. In fact, when vaccination
rates drop in a community, it's not uncommon to have an
outbreak.</p><h3>Diseases Don't Stop at the Border, and Many Can Spread
Easily</h3><p>You may have never seen a case of polio or diphtheria, but they
still occur in other countries. All it takes is a plane ride for
these diseases to arrive in your community. One example is measles.
Measles is not very common in the United States due to vaccination,
but it is still common in many parts of the world.  The
disease is brought into the United States by unvaccinated travelers
who are infected while abroad.</p><p>After reaching this country, measles can spread quickly among
unvaccinated people. Many of the cases in the United States in 2014
were associated with cases brought in from the Philippines, which
experienced a large measles outbreak. From January 1 to July 24,
2015, 183 people have been reported as having measles in the United
States. Most of these people were not vaccinated or didn't know if
they were vaccinated. And, nearly all the cases are associated with
international travel.</p><div class=\"pull-right span7\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><h3>Have More Questions, Need Fast Answers?</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Visit

vaccine supply in its history. Before a vaccine is approved and
given to children, it 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/journey-of-child-vaccine.html\" target=\"_blank\">
is tested extensively</a>. Scientists and medical professionals
carefully evaluate all the available information about the vaccine
to determine its safety and effectiveness. As new information and
science become available, vaccine recommendations are
updated.<br />
Although there may be some discomfort or tenderness at the
injection site, this is minor compared to the serious complications
that can result from the diseases these vaccines prevent. Serious
side effects from vaccines are very rare.

Learn how to make your child's shot visit less stressful.</a></p><p>Nearly all children can be safely vaccinated. There are some
exceptions including children with allergies to something in a
vaccine. Children with weakened immune systems due to an illness or
a medical treatment, such as chemotherapy, also may not be able to
safely receive some vaccines.</p><div class=\"pull-right span5\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><img alt=\"Mother holding daughter\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/reasonstovaccinate/reasonstovaccinate_b250px.jpg\" /><p>Protecting your child’s health and safety is very important.
That’s why parents choose immunization. It’s the powerful defense
that’s safe, proven, and effective.</p></div></div><h3>Children Need Protection Early</h3><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sets the
U.S. childhood immunization schedule based on recommendations from
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)—a group of
medical and public health experts. This schedule also is approved
by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American
Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). The 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/easy-to-read/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">
recommended childhood immunization schedule</a> is designed to
protect infants and children early in life, when they are most
vulnerable.</p><p>To be fully immunized, children need all doses of the vaccines
according to the recommended schedule. Not receiving the full
number of doses leaves a child vulnerable to catching serious
diseases. Check with your child's doctor to find out if your baby
is due for any vaccinations. Or, you can use this 

<a href=\"http://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/kidstuff/newscheduler_le/\" target=\"_blank\">online
tool</a> to enter your child's current record and quickly see if
any doses have been skipped or missed. It is important to your
child's health to be up-to-date on immunizations.</p><h3>Vaccines Mean Fewer Missed Work Days and School Days</h3><p>A child who gets a vaccine-preventable disease may have to miss
school or day care for many days or weeks. Time lost from work to
care for a sick child can cause a financial burden for the family.
These diseases can also cause lasting disabilities that result in
expensive medical bills and long-term care.</p><h3>Vaccination Protects Your Family, Friends, and Community</h3><p>Getting your child vaccinated helps protect others in your
community—like your neighbor who has cancer and cannot get certain
vaccines, or your best friend's newborn baby who is too young to be
fully vaccinated. When everyone in a community who <em>can</em> get
vaccinated <em>does</em> get vaccinated, it helps to prevent the
spread of disease and can slow or stop an outbreak. Choosing to
protect your child with vaccines is also a choice to help protect
your family, friends, and neighbors, too.</p><h3>Immunization Helps Give You the Power to Protect Your Baby</h3><p>For more reasons to vaccinate, talk with your child's doctor,
call 800-CDC-INFO, or visit

papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common sexually transmitted
infection that can lead to many health problems for Latinos and all
racial and ethnic groups. Learn how to reduce your risk and ways to
prevent HPV infection.</strong></p><h3>What is HPV?</h3><p>HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, and is a
different virus than HIV and HSV (herpes). HPV is so common that
nearly all sexually active men and women get it at some point in
their lives. You can get HPV by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex
with someone who has the virus, and it can be passed between
partners even when an infected person has no signs or symptoms. In
most cases, HPV goes away on its own and does not cause any health
problems. But when it doesn't go away, it can cause health issues
like genital warts and cervical and throat cancer.</p><div class=\"pull-right span5\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><img alt=\"Latino mother with daughters\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/hpv-latino/hpv-latino_a250px.jpg\" /><p>Hispanic women in the United States have higher rates of
cervical cancer than women in other racial or ethnic groups.</p></div></div><h3>HPV Among Hispanic and Latino Women</h3><p>Hispanic women in the United States have higher rates of
cervical cancer than women in other racial or ethnic
groups.<sup>1</sup> And in Puerto Rico specifically, cervical
cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. In
a 2014 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/14_0171.htm\" target=\"_blank\">study of
Puerto Rican Adolescents</a> and their mothers, researchers found
that women's knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccination was low,
especially among mothers.<sup>2</sup> Additionally, women's
concerns about the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine seemed
to be related to the thought that the HPV vaccine had neither been
promoted in Puerto Rico nor recommended by their health care
provider. Other studies with Hispanic populations reported similar
concerns about HPV vaccination.<sup>3,4,5</sup></p><p>The report, published in CDC's 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/\" target=\"_blank\">Preventing Chronic Disease</a>,
also revealed that few young women questioned as part of the study
knew that cervical cancer is caused by HPV, or that risk is
increased by having multiple sexual partners, or lack of routine
screening. Unvaccinated women had little knowledge about HPV or the
vaccine. Most mothers questioned had difficulty explaining what
cervical cancer is, and some mothers of unvaccinated girls thought
that cervical cancer was fatal like HIV.</p><p>It is important for Latinos and all racial and ethnic groups to
know what HPV is and the risks associated with the virus and other
sexually transmitted infections. Despite increases, coverage
estimates for the HPV vaccine among U.S. teens remained low in
2014, according to the 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/teens/vaccination-coverage.html\" target=\"_blank\">
2104 National Immunization Survey-Teen</a>. Four out of ten
adolescent girls and six out of ten adolescent boys haven't started
the HPV vaccine series, and are vulnerable to cancers caused by HPV
infections, according to the report. Cancers caused by HPV include
cervical cancer and cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis, or anus. It
can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the base
of the tongue and tonsils (called oropharyngeal cancer).</p><h3>Reduce Your HPV Risk</h3><p>There are ways for you to reduce your risk of getting HPV.
Vaccination, abstaining from smoking, and having regular cancer
screenings are a few ways you can reduce your chances of health
problems caused by HPV infection.</p><p>The HPV vaccine is also a safe and effective way to prevent the
HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer. HPV vaccination is
most effective when the complete HPV vaccine series is given at 11
or 12 years old, and the vaccine is recommended for all boys and
girls at this age. HPV vaccination is also recommended for males
through age 21 and for females through age 26, if they did not get
the vaccine when they were younger. HPV vaccination is also
recommended for gay and bisexual men (or any man who has sex with a
man), as well as for men with compromised immune systems through
age 26, if they did not get fully vaccinated when they were
younger.</p><p>For those who are sexually active, condoms may lower the risk of
HPV infections that can cause genital warts or cancer. To be most
effective, a condom should be used with every sex act, from start
to finish. But HPV can infect areas that are not covered by a
condom—so condoms may not fully protect against HPV infection.</p><p>People can also lower their chances of getting HPV by being in a
faithful relationship with one partner, limiting their number of
sex partners, and being with a partner who has had no or few prior
sex partners. But even people with only one lifetime sex partner
can get HPV and the health problems caused by HPV infection.</p><h3>References</h3><p><em>Content Source: <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>National

You only have one pair of eyes, so take care of them!</strong></p><p>When cared for properly, contact lenses can provide a
comfortable and convenient way to work, play, and live for the more
than 40 million people in the U.S. who wear them. While contact
lenses are usually a safe and effective form of vision correction,
they are not entirely risk-free—especially if they are not cared
for properly. To reap the benefits of wearing contact lenses, it is
essential to practice healthy habits.</p><h3>Contact Lens Health Week</h3><p>CDC, in close collaboration with 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/cdc-at-work.html\" target=\"_blank\">partners</a>,
has organized 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/contact-lens-health-week.html\" target=\"_blank\">
Contact Lens Health Week</a> as a strategy to increase public
awareness and promote healthy contact lens wear and care.
<strong>August 24-28, 2015,</strong> marks the second annual
Contact Lens Health Week, to coincide with \"back to school\" health
promotion efforts. The theme for this year's observance is
<strong>Healthy Habits Mean Healthy Eyes,</strong> and it targets
teenage contact lens wearers, their parents, and eye care
providers. Messages and materials are also suitable for contact
lens wearers of all other ages.</p><p>To kick off the observance week, CDC released an 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6432a2.htm?s_cid=mm6432a2_w\" target=\"_blank\">MMWR</a> article detailing the results of a
national survey that found <strong>more than 99% of contact lens
wearers</strong> may be engaging in at least one behavior known to
increase their risk of eye infections. The results presented in
this report highlight the need for education efforts to improve
contact lens hygiene behaviors.</p><h3>Healthy Habits=Healthy Eyes</h3><p>Enjoy the comfort and 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/benefits.html\" target=\"_blank\">benefits</a>
of contact lenses while lowering your chance of complications.
Failure to wear, clean, and store your lenses as directed by your
eye doctor raises the risk of developing serious 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/germs-infections.html\" target=\"_blank\">infections</a>
and 

<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/other-complications.html\" target=\"_blank\">other

by your eye doctor.</li></ul></li><li><h3>Your Eye Doctor</h3><ul><li><strong>Visit your eye doctor yearly</strong> or as often as he
or she recommends.</li><li><strong>Ask your eye doctor</strong> if you have questions
about how to care for your contact lenses and case or if you are
having any difficulties.</li><li><strong>Remove your contact lenses immediately and call your

Most children with chickenpox completely recover. But it can be
serious, even deadly, especially for babies, pregnant women,
adolescents, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Make
sure everyone in your family is up to date on their chickenpox
vaccinations.</strong></p><p>Chickenpox is a very contagious disease. Someone is at risk if
they have never been vaccinated or had chickenpox. Chickenpox
causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. This
leaves a person feeling very sick and uncomfortable, and may cause
sick people to miss a week or more of school or work.</p><p>Chickenpox can be serious. Before there was a vaccine,
chickenpox caused about 4 million people to get sick, more than
10,500 hospitalizations, and about 100 to 150 deaths each year.
Most people who had severe chickenpox were healthy beforehand. Read

died</a>.</p><div class=\"clear\"></div><div class=\"pull-right span7\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><h3>First the Rash, Then the Blisters</h3><p>Classic chickenpox symptoms are—</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li>Red, itchy rash that usually starts on the face, chest, and
back then spreads to the rest of the body</li><li>Fluid-filled blisters, resulting from the rash, that crust over
usually in one week </li></ul></div></div><h3>Chickenpox Vaccine: Your Best Protection</h3><p>Chickenpox vaccine is the best way to protect your family from
chickenpox. </p><p>CDC recommends:</p><ul><li>Children get the first dose of chickenpox vaccine at 12 through
15 months old and the second dose at age 4 through 6 years.</li><li>People 13 years of age and older who never had chickenpox or
been vaccinated should get two doses of chickenpox vaccine at least
28 days apart.</li></ul><p>If you or your child only got one dose in the past, check with
your doctor about getting a second dose.</p><div class=\"pull-right span7\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><h3>Chickenpox Can Be Serious</h3><p>Chickenpox can be serious especially for babies, pregnant women,
adolescents, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It
can cause—</p><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li>dehydration</li><li>pneumonia</li><li>bleeding problems</li><li>brain infection or inflammation</li><li>bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues in children
including Group A streptococcal infections</li><li>blood stream infections (sepsis)</li><li>toxic shock syndrome</li><li>bone infections</li><li>joint infections</li><li>death</li></ul></div></div><h3>Chickenpox vaccine is safer than getting Chickenpox</h3><p>Two doses of chickenpox vaccine are very effective at preventing
disease, including severe disease, complications, and death.
Although rare, you can get chickenpox if you have been vaccinated.
However, the symptoms are usually very mild, meaning fewer
blisters, little or no fever, and quicker recovery.</p><p>Also, when you get vaccinated, you protect others in your
community. This is especially important for people who cannot get
vaccinated. People who cannot get the chickenpox vaccine include
pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems. Learn more

you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to
the doctor. Learn

Program may be able to help. This program helps families of
eligible children who might not otherwise have access to vaccines.

contagious disease caused by a virus. Anyone who has not had mumps
or been vaccinated can get the disease. There is no treatment for
mumps, and it can cause long-term health problems. You can protect
yourself and your family against mumps with
vaccination.</strong></p><h3>Protect Your Child with Mumps Vaccine</h3><p>Mumps vaccine is the best way to protect your child against
mumps. It is usually given as part of a combination vaccine that
protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR).
The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Most children don’t have any
side effects from the vaccine. The side effects that do occur are
usually very mild, such as a fever or rash.</p><p>Children should get two doses of MMR vaccine:</p><ul><li>the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and</li><li>the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.</li></ul><div class=\"pull-right margin-top-ten span5\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><img alt=\"Photo: Child with Mumps\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/mumps/mumps_225px.jpg\" /><p>Mumps typically starts with fever, headache, muscle aches,
tiredness, and loss of appetite. Then, most people will have
swelling of their salivary glands. This is what causes the puffy
cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw.</p></div></div><p>Your child's doctor may also offer the MMRV vaccine, a
combination vaccine that protects against four diseases: measles,
mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox). Talk to your child's
healthcare professional for help deciding which vaccine to use.</p><p>Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated U.S.
communities, particularly in close-contact settings such as
schools, colleges, and camps. However, high vaccination coverage
helps to limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks,
making it that much more important to 

<a href=\"http://www2a.cdc.gov/nip/kidstuff/newscheduler_le/\" target=\"_blank\">get
your child vaccinated on schedule</a>. </p><h3>Protect yourself against Mumps</h3><p>Anyone born during or after 1957, who has never had mumps or has
never been vaccinated, is at risk for mumps. They should get at
least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Two doses are recommended for
adults at higher risk, such as students in college, trade school,
and training programs;

serious, long-lasting problems including:</p><ul><li>encephalitis (swelling of the brain),</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/viral.html\" target=\"_blank\">meningitis</a> (swelling of
the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord),</li><li>loss of hearing (temporary and permanent),</li><li>orchitis (swelling of the testicles) in males who have reached
puberty,</li><li>oophoritis (swelling of the ovaries) and/or mastitis (swelling
of the breasts) in females who have reached puberty.</li></ul><p>In rare cases, mumps is deadly.</p><h3>Paying for Mumps Vaccine</h3><p>Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However,
you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to
the doctor.

Just as schools are critical settings for preparing students
academically, they are also vital partners in helping young people
take responsibility for their own health. Learn what schools can do
to support HIV/STD prevention and testing.</strong></p><h3>Why schools?</h3><p>There are nearly 42 million adolescents in the United States. Of
these, 37 million (91%) attend a public or private school for at
least 6 hours a day during the most critical years of their social,
physical, and intellectual development. After the family home,
schools are the primary places responsible for the development of
young people. School health education can help teens adopt lifelong
attitudes and behaviors that support overall health and
well-being—including those that reduce their risk for HIV and other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and pregnancy.</p><h3>HIV, STD, &amp; Teen Pregnancy Prevention</h3><p>Many young people engage in sexual risk behaviors that can
result in unintended health outcomes. For example, among U.S. high
school students surveyed in 2013<sup>1</sup></p><ul><li>47% have had sexual intercourse at least once </li><li>34% are currently sexually active </li><li>15% have had four or more sex partners during their
life </li><li>Only 13% of students had ever been tested for HIV</li></ul><p>Sexual risk behaviors place adolescents at risk for HIV
infection and other STDs, as well as for unintended
pregnancies.</p><ul><li>Nearly 10,000 young people (aged 13-24) were diagnosed with HIV
infection in the U.S. in 2013.<sup>2</sup></li><li>Young gay and bisexual men (aged 13-24) accounted for an
estimated 19% (8,800) of all new HIV infections in the United
States, and 72% of new HIV infections among youth in
2010.<sup>3</sup></li><li>Nearly half of the 20 million new STDs each year were among
young people, between the ages of 15 to 24.<sup>4</sup></li><li>Approximately 273,000 babies were born to teen girls aged 15–19
years in 2013.<sup>5</sup></li></ul><div class=\"pull-right span5\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><img alt=\"Group of students\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/hivstdprevention/hivstdprevention_a250px.jpg\" /><p>Well-designed HIV/STD prevention programs can significantly
reduce sexual risk behaviors among teens</p></div></div><h3>What can schools do to support HIV and STD prevention?</h3><p>Research shows that well-designed, well-implemented HIV/STD
prevention programs can significantly reduce sexual risk behaviors
among teens. A review of 48 comprehensive curriculum-based sex and
STD/HIV education programs found that none of these programs
increased the likelihood of teens having sex, while about
two-thirds had a significant impact on reducing sexual risk
behaviors among young people,<sup>6,7</sup> including</p><ul><li>delay in first sexual intercourse</li><li>decline in the number of sex partners</li><li>increase in condom or contraceptive use</li></ul><h3>What can schools do to support HIV and STD testing?</h3><p>Making HIV testing a routine part of health care for teens and
adults aged 13–64 years is an important strategy recommended by CDC
to reduce the spread of HIV.<sup>8</sup> HIV testing is also an
integral part of the 

<a href=\"https://www.aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to External Web Site\"><em>National
HIV/AIDS Strategy</em></a><em>,</em> which calls for all Americans
to be educated about HIV. This includes knowing how HIV is
transmitted and prevented, and knowing which behaviors place
individuals at greatest risk for infection. To prevent the spread
of HIV and improve health outcomes for those who are already
infected, HIV awareness and education should be universally
integrated into all educational environments.<sup>9</sup></p><p>State and local education agencies and schools are essential
partners in this effort. Schools can help support HIV and STD
testing by</p><ul><li>Teaching students about HIV and other STDs</li><li>Promoting communication between parents and adolescents</li><li>Teaching students how to find HIV counseling and testing
services</li><li>Providing referrals to testing, counseling, and treatment
services</li><li>Providing on-site testing for HIV and STDs</li></ul><h3>What is CDC Doing?</h3><p>CDC provides funding and assistance that enables state and local
education agencies to deliver HIV prevention programs that are
scientifically sound and grounded in the latest research on
effectiveness. Many of the strategies implemented by schools to
prevent HIV infection can also help young people avoid other STDs,
as well as pregnancy.</p><p>CDC-funded activities include</p><ul><li>Helping communities collect and analyze data on the sexual risk
behaviors of young people to ensure that programs are data driven
and responsive to local needs.</li><li>Implementing HIV/STD prevention programs and curricula that are
medically accurate, have evidence of effectiveness, and teach
critical knowledge and skills to prevent infection.</li><li>Providing professional development to ensure that teachers have
the knowledge and skills to effectively teach young people how to
protect themselves from HIV/STD infection.</li><li>Ensuring safe and supportive school climates that increase
student engagement with schools; reduce discrimination, bullying,
and isolation; and decrease the likelihood that students will
engage in risky behaviors.</li><li>Supporting the adoption and implementation of critical policies
related to infection control procedures and confidentiality for
students and staff with HIV infection.</li><li>Establishing links to community-based health services that
provide testing, counseling, and treatment for HIV and other
STDs.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><ol><li>CDC.

Starting school later can help improve an adolescent’s health,
academic performance and quality of life.</strong></p><p>Most American adolescents start school too early. According to a


<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_w\" target=\"_blank\">
CDC study</a> that analyzed US Department of Education data from
the 2011-2012 school year, less than 1 of 5 middle and high schools
began at 8:30 a.m. or later. The 

<a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/08/19/peds.2014-1697\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> has recommended
that middle and high schools start at 8:30 a.m. or later to allow
students the opportunity to get the recommended amount of sleep on
school nights, about 8.5-9.5 hours. Insufficient sleep is common
among high school students and is associated with several health
risks including being overweight, drinking alcohol, smoking
tobacco, and using drugs, as well as poor academic performance.</p><h3>Study Results</h3><ul><li>Among an estimated 39,700 public middle, high, and combined
schools in the United States, the average start time was 8:03
a.m.</li><li>42 states reported that most (75%-100%) public schools started
before 8:30 a.m.</li><li>The percentage of schools starting at 8:30 a.m. or later varied
greatly. For example, 

<ul><li>No schools in Hawaii, Mississippi, and Wyoming started after
8:30 a.m.</li><li>Most schools in schools in North Dakota (78%) and Alaska (76%)
started after 8:30 a.m.</li><li>Louisiana had the earliest average school start time (7:40 AM)
and Alaska had the latest average school start time (8:33 AM).</li></ul></li></ul><div class=\"pull-right span5\"><div class=\"module-typeC\"><img alt=\"Alert student in class, raising hand\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/features/school-start-times/school-start-times_a250px.jpg\" /><p>Adequate sleep enables improved academic performance.</p></div></div><h3>What are the effects of early school start times on
adolescents?</h3><ul><li>Adolescents who do not get enough sleep are more likely to 

<ul><li>Be overweight.</li><li>Not engage in daily physical activity.</li><li>Suffer from depressive symptoms.</li><li>Engage in unhealthy risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking
tobacco, and using illicit drugs.</li><li>Perform poorly in school.</li></ul></li><li>Students who get about 8.5-9.5 hours of sleep each night can
improve their health, safety, academic performance, and quality of
life.</li></ul><h3>Everyone Can Play an Important Role</h3><p><em>Parents</em></p><ul><li>Model and encourage habits that help promote good sleep such as


<ul type=\"circle\"><li>Setting a regular bedtime and rise time, including on weekends,
is recommended for everyone— children, adolescents, and adults
alike. 

<ul type=\"square\"><li>Adolescents with parent-set bedtimes usually get more sleep
than those whose parents do not set bedtimes.</li></ul></li><li>Dim lighting, adolescents who are exposed to more light (such
as room lighting or from electronics) in the evening are less
likely to get enough sleep.</li><li>Implement a “media curfew,-technology use (computers, video
gaming, or mobile phones) may also contribute to late bedtimes.
Parents should consider banning technology use after a certain time
or removing these technologies from the bedroom.</li></ul></li><li>Contact local school officials about later school start times.
Be aware of some commonly mentioned barriers, such as concerns
about increased transportation costs and scheduling
difficulties.</li></ul><p><em>Health care professionals</em></p><ul><li>Educate adolescent patients and their parents about the
importance of adequate sleep and factors that contribute to
insufficient sleep among adolescents.</li></ul><p><em>School officials</em></p><ul><li>Learn more about the research connecting sleep and school start
times. Good sleep hygiene in combination with later school times
will enable adolescents to be healthier and better academic
achievers.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"syndicate\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><div class=\"mSyndicate\"><h3>More Information</h3><ul class=\"list-bullet\"><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/sleep/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC's Sleep and

School Violence</a><br />
While US schools remain relatively safe, any amount of violence is
unacceptable. Parents, teachers, and administrators expect schools
to be safe havens of learning. Acts of violence can disrupt the
learning process and have a negative effect on students, the school
itself, and the broader community.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/youthviolence/\" target=\"_blank\">Youth
Violence</a><br />
Youth violence can take different forms, such as fighting,
bullying, threats with weapons, and gang-related violence. It is a
leading cause of death and injuries of young people between the
ages of 10 and 24 in the United States.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">
Sexual Violence</a><br />
Sexual violence begins early in life. Eighty percent of female
victims experienced their first rape before the age of 25 and about
40 percent experienced the first rape before age 18. Most victims
do not tell friends and family about the abuse and suffer alone.
Those who do disclose the violence may be stigmatized by friends,
family, and their community.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Suicide</a><br />
Suicide (taking one's own life) is a serious public health problem
that affects even young people. It is the second leading cause of
death among youth and young adults between the ages of 10 and 24.
Suicide results in 5,200 lives lost each year.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/youthviolence/pdf/opportunities-for-action.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">
